    "question": "You are testing a sort function. The logs indicate TC3, TC4, and TC5 fail when there are duplicate values. What is the best description for a defect report?",
    "alternatives": {
      "a": "The system fails to sort several sets of numbers. Reference: TC3, TC4, TC5.",
      "b": "The system seems to disregard duplicates while sorting. Reference: TC3, TC4, TC5.",
      "c": "The system fails to sort negative numbers. Reference: TC4, TC5.",
      "d": "TC3, TC4 and TC5 have defects (duplicate input data) and should be corrected."
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "The test log shows missing duplicates in output, which implies the system removes them during sorting."

    "alternatives": {
      "a": "It provides coverage measures that are too complicated for humans to derive",
      "b": "It shares responsibility for the testing with the tool vendor",
