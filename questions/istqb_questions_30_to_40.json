    "question": "You want to estimate the test effort for the new project using estimation based on ratios. You calculate the test-to-development effort ratio using averaged data for both development effort and test effort from four historical projects similar to the new one. The table shows this historical data.\nP1: 800,000 (dev), 40,000 (test)\nP2: 1,200,000 (dev), 130,000 (test)\nP3: 600,000 (dev), 70,000 (test)\nP4: 1,000,000 (dev), 120,000 (test)\nThe estimated development effort for the new project is $800,000.

    "question": "Which of the following BEST describes an example of how configuration management (CM) supports testing?",
    "alternatives": {
      "a": "Having the version number of the environment, the CM tool can retrieve the version numbers of libraries, stubs and drivers used in that environment",
      "b": "Having a record of the values of the test inputs, the CM tool can execute the test cases for these configurations and calculate test coverage",
      "c": "Having data about the date of purchase of a software license, the CM tool automatically generates information about the fact that the product license is coming to an end",
      "d": "Having the version number of the test case, the CM tool can automatically generate test data for this test case"
